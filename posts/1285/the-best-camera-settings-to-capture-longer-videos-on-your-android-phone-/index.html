Adjusting Your Phone Settings<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-adjusting-your-phone-settings>#</a></h3><p>1.Did you know that you can actually get longer videos and optimize your phone’s battery life by adjusting the camera settings? There are several ways to tweak the settings to get better battery life and performance.
2.The first step to take is to lower the resolution. You can lower the resolution to a lower setting than the max resolution. Lower resolutions require less power from the battery and result in lesser heat.
3.You should also adjust the video frame rate. Generally, lower frame rates mean fewer frames per second and thus require less computing power. This in turn helps preserve battery life.
4.Finally, turn off image stabilization and other special effects such as HDR and real-time filters. These settings require more processing power which can drain your phone’s battery quickly. By turning them off, you can save battery life and get longer videos.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/HTUjJoMNWqo style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: What are the best camera settings to capture longer videos on an Android phone?
