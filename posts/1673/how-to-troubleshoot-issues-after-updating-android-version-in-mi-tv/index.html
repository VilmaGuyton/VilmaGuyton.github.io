Steps to Clear Cache and Data of Apps on Mi TV<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-steps-to-clear-cache-and-data-of-apps-on-mi-tv>#</a></h3><p>One of the easiest solutions to troubleshoot your Mi TV after updating Android version is to clear cache and data of its apps. To do this, first, head to Settings > Security & Restrictions > Apps > App Manager. Select the app that you want to fix and clear the cache and data. You can also select all the apps and click ‘Clear cache’ and ‘Clear data’ to get it done at once. This can help in fixing certain errors that are due to cache and unwanted data files.</p><p>After completing the steps, you will have to start an app and let it configure after the update. You might not immediately notice the improvement but it will eventually become smoother.</p><p>Moreover, you can always go into the basic settings of the apps and reset any custom settings that you have applied for better performance. This can directly boost the performance of the app after the update. Do note that this step might require some trial and error.</p><p>You can also try to re-install apps that are not working correctly. This will help you get rid of any other possible errors which might be causing the issue. To re-install an app, head to the App Store and reinstall the apps. Then launch the app and it should now be working correctly.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mKboGVsNNvk style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: What is the recommended way to troubleshoot issues after updating android version in Mi TV?</p><p>A1: The recommended way to troubleshoot issues that arise after updating your Android version in Mi TV is to carefully inspect each step of the update process, ensure that the update was properly transferred and installed correctly, and then restart your device.
