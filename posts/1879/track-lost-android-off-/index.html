Having your precious phone go missing can be one of the most nerve-wracking experiences. After all, many of us rely heavily on our devices, as our schedules and routines revolve around them! There is nothing worse than the feeling of being separated from our device with no idea on how to recover it. But guess what? There is a way to track your lost Android phone even when it is switched off! Here are the steps on how to do so.\nFirst of all, you need to have the ‘Find My Device’ app installed on your phone prior to its loss. This app can be found on the Google Play Store and is free to download. Once that is installed, you will need to go to the “Find My Device” website. Now, locate your device using either its GPS location or its IMEI number. If your device is switched off, you will be able to see its date and time of its last location.\nNext, you can click on “Ring” which will cause your lost phone to ring at its highest volume for a maximum of 5 minutes, regardless if it is switched off or not. With this feature, you can listen out for your device, and possibly find it.\nIf that does not work, you can also try activating the “Lock \u0026 Erase” feature on the “Find My Device” website. This will send a signal to your lost phone with a new password, rendering the phone useless until the correct password is entered. With this, you can protect your data in case your device is stolen.\nFinally, you can contact the nearest police station if you suspect your device to have been stolen. With the help from the GPS location provided by “Find My Device”, you can provide the police with the exact location of your lost phone.\nSo, there you have it, a detailed step-by-step guide on how to track your lost Android phone even when it is switched off. Do not give up hope of finding your device, for there are still many ways of recovering it.\nAccording to a study by Malwarebytes, 21% of the lost phones are turned off by the thief or the person who found it.

This will allow you to remotely locate, lock, and erase your lost phone, even when it’s switched off.

But they can be very valuable if your phone is lost and not stolen.”\n1.

Here are the steps you need to take in order to request your service provider to block and track your lost Android phone:</p><ol><li><p>Contact your service provider via phone or online. Provide them with all the relevant information like your account ID, phone brand, and model number.</p></li><li><p>Ask them to block your phone. Most service providers will be able to do this easily.</p></li><li><p>Request them to track the last location of your phone. This will help you narrow down your search for the lost device.</p></li><li><p>Provide any other information that you might have that can help your service provider do a more accurate search for your phone. This can include the last known location or other details related to the phone.</p></li></ol><h3 id=1-request-service-provider-to-block-phone>1. Request Service Provider to Block Phone<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-request-service-provider-to-block-phone>#</a></h3><p>One of the most important steps to take when you&rsquo;ve lost your Android phone is to reach out to your service provider. You can ask them to block the phone and track its last known location. This can be one of the easiest ways to locate your phone if it has been switched off. Once your service provider has blocked your device, no one, not even you, will be able to access or use the phone.</p><p>The next step you can take is to use the Android Device Manager to locate your phone. The Android Device Manager will help you to map the exact location of your phone. All you need to do is install the app through the Google Play Store and enter your Google credentials.</p><p>Once you have located your device, you can also remotely lock it or erase its data from a distance. You can also set a new password and make your phone accessible only to you.</p><p>It is important to realize that the steps listed above are only effective if your phone is still operating. If your device is not powering on, or if it has been stolen, then you may need to contact the local police to recover your device and investigate the theft.</p><h3 id=2-track-last-location-of-lost-phone>2.
