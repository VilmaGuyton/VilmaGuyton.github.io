Once you have confirmed the reset, your iPhone will restart and you will have to set it up as if it were a new device.</p><p>After you have reset your iPhone and set it up, you can begin restoring your data.

If you find that your transfer is taking too long, you can turn on airplane mode on your iPhone, which will pause the transfer. Once you have finished transferring your data, you can turn airplane mode off and you will have all of your Android data on your iPhone.</p><p>In conclusion, moving data from an Android to an iPhone can be a challenging task.
