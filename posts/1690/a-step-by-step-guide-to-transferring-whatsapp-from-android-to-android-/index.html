Preparing Your Devices<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-preparing-your-devices>#</a></h3><p>Transferring WhatsApp from Android to Android is not as hard as it might seem. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you with the process. First, you need to make sure your current device is running the latest software version. Once that is in check, you can start the transfer.

After downloading the app, you will be prompted to enter your WhatsApp verification code which will be sent to your old device. After you’ve entered the verification code, the transfer process should begin. Once finished, you will be able to access your entire WhatsApp chat history on your new device. Lastly, make sure to delete the Move to iOS app from the Google Play Store to avoid any unnecessary conflicts. Following these steps should ensure a smooth and successful transfer of WhatsApp from Android to Android.</p><h3 id=2-transferring-whatsapp-data>2.

Finally, the app will transfer your WhatsApp data over to your new device. Once the transfer is complete, open the WhatsApp app on the receiving device and verify your phone number.
