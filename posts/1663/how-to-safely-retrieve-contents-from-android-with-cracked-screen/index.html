However, with the right steps, you can retrieve the contents of your phone without any issues. To start, you will need a USB data cable, a laptop, and a third-party app to help you transfer your content. Once you have downloaded and installed the third-party app on your laptop, connect your phone to the laptop using the USB cable.

Once the transfer is complete, you can disconnect the phone and start setting up your new device. Lastly, make sure to delete the app from your laptop to protect your data.</p><h3 id=1-necessary-requirements>1.

To start transferring data from your Android device, select the File Transfer option available in the notification dropdown menu. Lastly, select the desired files you wish to transfer and click the Copy-to-PC button.

Transferring Data<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-transferring-data>#</a></h3><p>Data transfer is one of the most common procedures when dealing with a damaged phone. It allows a user to transfer vital information such as contacts, messages, pictures from the damaged device to another. If you have an Android device with a cracked screen, there are several methods you can use to safely retrieve its contents. Firstly, you can back up your device using Smart Switch, a proprietary software from Samsung.

Secondly, you can use a compatible wireless adapter such as the SanDisk Wireless Flash Drive or the Transcend JetDrive Go to connect your device with another, and transfer your files. Thirdly, you can use cloud services such as Dropbox or Google Drive to store your files and retrieve them on another device. Finally, you can connect your broken device to your computer using a USB cable and access its files via your file manager application.
